# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Project 1: Navigation

### Project details

In this project, an agent navigates in a large, square world and collects bananas.

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, an agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in root of the folder and unzip the file.

3. Run Navigation.ipynb to test the environment.

### Instructions

The solution includes 3 notebooks:

- Navigation_DQN.ipynb implements deep Q-network (DQN) with experience replay and fixed Q-targets
- Navigation_Priority_DQN implements DQN with prioritize experience replay and fixed Q-targets
- Navigation_Pixel_DQN.ipynb implements DQN for the project (see next section), where state is an 84 x 84 RGB image

In addition, code shared by the notebooks is located in python files:

- qnet.py implements a dense neural network used as q-network by the agents in the notebooks
- utils.py implements utility functions used by the notebooks

To train agents, run all the cells in one of the notebooks. Description of the implementation, results and analysis can be found in report.pdf.


### (Optional) Challenge: Learning from Pixels

In the project, the agent learns from information such as its velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around its forward direction. A more challenging task is to learn directly from pixels!

To solve this harder task, you'll need to download a new Unity environment.  This environment is almost identical to the project environment, where the only difference is that the state is an 84 x 84 RGB image, corresponding to the agent's first-person view.

You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
- Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/VisualBanana_Linux.zip)
- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/VisualBanana.app.zip)
- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/VisualBanana_Windows_x86.zip)
- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/VisualBanana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

Then, place the file in the `p1_navigation/` folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip the file.

(_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS, you must follow the instructions to [set up X Server](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above.
